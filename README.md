#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, and maintaining software systems.

Its importance in the technology industry lies in its role in creating reliable, efficient, and user-friendly software. This is essential because software powers everything from smartphones and computers to cars and medical equipment. Without proper software engineering, technology would be less reliable and more prone to errors, affecting how we live and work daily.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The Birth of Programming Languages (1950s-1960s): Early programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL were developed, allowing engineers to write instructions in a more human-readable form. This marked the transition from machine-level code to higher-level languages, making software development more accessible and efficient.
2.Structured Programming (1970s): The introduction of structured programming techniques, like using loops and conditionals, helped developers create more organized and readable code. This reduced errors and made complex software easier to manage and maintain.
3.Agile Methodology (2000s): Agile transformed software development by emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and iterative progress. Instead of following a rigid plan, teams work in short cycles, constantly refining and improving the software. This approach allows for quicker adaptation to changes and more responsive development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: creating high level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
implementation: writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements 
Deployment: releasing the software to users or customers
maintenance: providing ongoing support, update,and enhancements to the software after deployment 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Structure vs. Flexibility: Waterfall is rigid and linear, suitable for projects with clear, unchanging requirements, while Agile is flexible and adaptive, ideal for projects where requirements may change.
Documentation: Waterfall relies heavily on documentation before any coding begins, whereas Agile focuses more on working software over comprehensive documentation.
Customer Involvement: Waterfall involves the customer mainly at the beginning and end of the project, while Agile involves continuous customer feedback throughout the development process.

waterfall methodologist:
Large, complex projects with well-defined requirements, such as government contracts or infrastructure projects, where changes are unlikely.
Example: Building a flight control system for an airplane, where safety and regulatory compliance are critical, and requirements must be rigorously defined from the start.
Agile methodologist
Startups or tech companies where rapid development and flexibility are crucial for staying competitive.
Example: Developing a new e-commerce platform where customer needs and market demands might change rapidly, requiring frequent updates and iterations.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer: responsible for writing code and implementing softwaare solutions 
quality assurance engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
project manager: overseesthe planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
